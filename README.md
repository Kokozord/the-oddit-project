# THE ODDIT PROJECT

A Reddit clone made with Rails API + React, as the final project for the
JavaScript course in The Odin Project.

Most of Reddit's important features are implemented, such as:

- Creating Halls (subreddits)
- Creating posts as Text-only, image-only or URL-only
- Commenting, with nested comments
- Adding and removing moderators to a hall
- Customizing hall sidebars
- Subscribing to a hall, which populates a user's /feed
- Voting and downvoting posts and comments
- User profiles, which display info about that user

There's more things I would like to implement, but as of current release this is as far
as I want to go with this project. Doing this was a great learning experience, and I'm sure
spending more time would teach me even more, but I'd like to move on to something different.
